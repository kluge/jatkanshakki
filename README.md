Jätkänshakki - 5-in-a-row Tic Tac Toe
=====================================

A simple 5-in-a-row Tic Tac Toe written in C++ that has a QML UI.

There are four different levels of AI. The first level "Trivial" just picks a
random free square to put its mark in. The next levels use progressively deeper
tree searches. The AI is limited to using 1 s to think.
